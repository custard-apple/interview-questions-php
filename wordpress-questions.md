###### Q. What are mu-plugins?


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

A must-use plugin (also called a ‘mu-plugin’) is a plugin that will always be activated by default, without you needing to do it yourself. To activate a mu-plugin, you just have to upload it in the right directory, and WordPress will automatically know that this plugin must be used. Moreover, a mu-plugin cannot be deactivated: it will always be executed, unless it is uninstalled.

Originally, mu-plugins were only available for WPMU, for those sites which used multiple (multisite) blogs. Back then, a mu-plugin was just a plugin activated for all blogs.

Now, since the version 2.8, this feature is in the main branch of WordPress and the ‘MU’ part in mu-plugins has a new meaning: from ‘multi-user’, it became ‘must-use’ and the use of this feature has been changed.
